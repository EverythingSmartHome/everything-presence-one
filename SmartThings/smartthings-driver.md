## Driver installation

The Samsung SmartThings Edge driver is in Beta currently which means we need to add it to our SmartThings account.

First, [click this link](https://bestow-regional.api.smartthings.com/invite/adMKdn651029) to accept the invitation to the Everything Presence One driver.

Make sure you are logged into your Samsung account.
