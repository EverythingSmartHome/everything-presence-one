Next hit Scan for Nearby Devices:

After a few seconds, the SmartThings app will automagically detect the EP1 on the network and add it to your hub. This uses mDNS, which should work by default on most networks, unless you have disabled it or have a more advanced network setup - read on if it isn't auto discovered:

If you want to rename the device to a more suitable name, hit the rename button and change the name:
