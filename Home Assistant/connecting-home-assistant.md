## Connecting to Home Assistant (Automatic method)

For most people, Home Assistant will automatically discover and add the EP1 immediately, thanks to ESPHome's mDNS discovery.

To add it to Home Assistant, simply head to Settings > Devices and Services and you should see the Everything Presence One has been automatically discovered and is displayed - simply hit the configure button to add it to Home Assistant and that's it!

## Connecting to Home Assistant (Manual method)

If for some reason the Everything Presence One is not automatically discovered, or your network is not setup for mDNS you can add the EP1 manually to Home Assistant.

You will need to first figure out what the IP address of your EP1 is by checking your routers web page:

You can also use a program like [fing](https://www.fing.com) to discover network devices.

Once you have the IP address, head over to Home Assistant and go to Settings > Devices and Services and click the add Integration button in the bottom right.
