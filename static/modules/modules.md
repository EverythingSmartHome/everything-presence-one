# Modules

The Everything Presence One has some spare GPIO pins which let's it work with some optional modules to extend its functionality.

We currently offer a [Carbon Dioxide CO2 module](https://shop.everythingsmart.io/products/everything-presence-one-lite-co2-add-on), with more planned soon.

See instructions for integrating the CO2 module.
